====================== MAIN IDEA ===========================

This code, made in assembly x86, is a bootloader to
a subject called Operating Systems at University of Sao Paulo

Using a external device and running the makefile operations, the
user should be able to create a bootable device in order to execute
before the operating system it already has on its PC

This bootloader will start asking for a sequence of characters and
tell the user if this set of chars is a palindrome or not. After that
the computer can be turned off

That's it...

==================== SPECIAL THANKS ========================

We'd like to add here special thanks to the teacher who helped
us on this development, Monaco F. J. (monacofj on GitHub)


= Building Rules and Troubleshooting (copied from the teacher) ===



 BUILDING RULES
 --------------

 At the terminal prompt, command

    $ make

 builds your MBR image (boot loader binary).

 You may test it using the x86 emulator by issuing

    $ make test

 In order to build a bootable ISO image for a USB memory stick, issue

    $ make iso

 and to test it, use

    $ make test-iso

 To copy the iso image to your physical USB memory stick, use

    $ make stick

 Other rules such as clean etc. work as usual.

 TROUBLESHOOTING
 ---------------

 If you have problems booting your image with the emulator, make sure your
 image has the right size and boot signature. This is the main cause of
 booting failures.

 If you have problems booting your iso image through your USB stick, check
 your BIOS configuration settings, specially boot options. You may need to
 enable legacy BIOS support, or to disable security boot features.
